Patrick McHeffey earned his Master of Urban Affairs degree from Boston University and his Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Roger Williams University. He is a father, a husband, and a public official in his local village government. He is a self-declared “indefatigable optimist.”

His 2017 petition, “We the People Sign Onto the Paris Agreement” garnered over half a million signatures, inspired subsequent petitions, and was presented at both the United Nations headquarters in New York, and at COP23 in Bonne, Germany. These experiences, coupled with that of becoming a father, ignited within him a desire to do more to improve our relationship with our living earth.
