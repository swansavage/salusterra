  only rational choice.


  At **Salus Terra**, we simplify complex topics related to climate change
  policy in order to help you understand this emerging and important field.
  Salus Terra literally means the Health of the Earth. Two thousand years ago,
  Marcus Tullius Cicero declared, “Salus populi suprema lex esto,” or ‘the
  health of the people should be the supreme law.’ We take this one step further
  and assert that the **health of the planet** should be the supreme law.
